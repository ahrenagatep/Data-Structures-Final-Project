# D.S. Final Project: YourFitnessTracker

**YourFitnessTracker** is a fitness application and my final project for my Data Structures class. It uses 7 data structures to manage workout routines, calorie tracking, and user profiles efficiently. The application features a user-friendly interface powered by JavaSwing and FlatLaf for an aesthetically pleasing dark mode.

## Features
- Create personalized fitness plans tailored to individual goals.
- Track calories and log workouts with intuitive input methods.
- Search and customize exercises using binary search trees.
- Manage fitness data using robust data structures for performance and scalability.

## Data Structures Used:
### Overview.java
- **ArrayList**: Used to store and fitness and health tips on the main menu.

### Workouts.java
- **Queue**: Stores the workout plan, allowing efficient retrieval and modification of exercises in order.
- **Binary Search Tree**: Used for searching exercises quickly in alphabetical order.
- **HashMap**: Manages pre-defined workout routines mapped to fitness types (e.g., strength, endurance).

### CalorieTracker.java
- **LinkedList**: Stores daily calorie intake data for dynamic manipulation.
- **Stack**: Implements a history feature for undoing calorie entries.
- **Bubble Sort**: Used for sorting calorie entries by date or magnitude.
